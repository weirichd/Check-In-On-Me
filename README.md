# Check-In-On-Me
A small Flask app I made to track my friends durring covid 19 stuff 

---

I made this to learn a little about how to make a web app with Flask and to help me keep track of my friends and family
during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.

Only really intended for personal use but I might add documentation at some point.
The code is pretty simple so you can probably figure it out, honestly.
